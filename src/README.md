# Source Code Directory

This directory contains source code generated by the AD-SDLC system.

## Structure

The structure depends on the target project type:

### TypeScript/JavaScript Project
```
src/
├── index.ts           # Entry point
├── types/             # Type definitions
├── lib/               # Core libraries
├── services/          # Business logic
└── utils/             # Utility functions
```

### Python Project
```
src/
├── __init__.py
├── main.py            # Entry point
├── models/            # Data models
├── services/          # Business logic
└── utils/             # Utility functions
```

## Code Generation Flow

1. Worker Agent receives Work Order
2. Worker analyzes context and related files
3. Worker generates/modifies code
4. Worker writes unit tests
5. Worker runs self-verification
6. PR Reviewer creates pull request

## Coding Standards

Generated code follows:
- Project-specific coding conventions
- Language-specific best practices
- Existing patterns in the codebase
- 80% minimum test coverage

## Notes

- This directory is initially empty
- Code is generated during the implementation phase
- All code changes go through PR review
