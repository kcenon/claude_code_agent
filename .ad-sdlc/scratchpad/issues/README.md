# Issues Directory

This directory stores issue tracking data generated by the Issue Generator Agent (CMP-005).

## Structure

```
issues/{project_id}/
├── issue_list.json        # List of generated issues
└── dependency_graph.json  # Issue dependency relationships
```

## File Descriptions

### issue_list.json
Contains all generated GitHub issues:
```json
{
  "project_id": "001",
  "generated_at": "2025-12-27T10:00:00Z",
  "issues": [
    {
      "id": "ISS-001",
      "github_number": 42,
      "title": "[AGENT] CMP-001: Create Collector Agent",
      "component": "CMP-001",
      "priority": "P0",
      "phase": "phase-1",
      "dependencies": [],
      "status": "open"
    }
  ]
}
```

### dependency_graph.json
Issue dependency relationships for scheduling:
```json
{
  "nodes": ["ISS-001", "ISS-002", "ISS-003"],
  "edges": [
    {"from": "ISS-002", "to": "ISS-001"},
    {"from": "ISS-003", "to": "ISS-002"}
  ],
  "critical_path": ["ISS-001", "ISS-002", "ISS-003"]
}
```

## Workflow

1. SDS Writer completes design specification
2. Issue Generator reads SDS and creates issues
3. Issues are pushed to GitHub via `gh` CLI
4. Controller reads dependency graph for scheduling

## Notes

- Issues are linked to SDS components (CMP-XXX)
- Dependency graph enables topological sorting for execution order
- GitHub issue numbers are recorded for traceability
